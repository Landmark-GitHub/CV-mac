# About Me

## Biography

Hey there! I am Chatchalerm Jhurjhan student at the [Engineering Program in Software Engineering (Soft-en)](https://tupine.engr.tu.ac.th) department of [Thammasat University](https://tu.ac.th).

I'm trying to find a balance between research and engineering.

My current research interests primarily focus on understanding and enhancing the continuity, generalizability, efficiency, and other key properties of machine learning. I am also interested in large multimodal models.

I'm also learning web development and building machine learning software and systems.
